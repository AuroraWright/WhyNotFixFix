# WhyNotFixFix
This is my attempt at merging the best out of the English subs for the original Steins;Gate fansubs. I've mostly done no work on my own apart for the actual merging and checking the result against the original Blu-Ray video tracks.
These subs include:
* Scripts and signs from the WhyNotFix subs: https://bitbucket.org/Woote/whynotfix (I just fixed a couple typos somewhere along the way)
* Script/sign timings from Beatrice-Raws. This matches the untouched Blu-Ray tracks rather than WhyNot's (edited?) OP/ED-less tracks.
* OP/ED from deanzel, but the translation for the OP was replaced with a slightly modified one from lyricstranslate: https://lyricstranslate.com/en/hacking-gate-hacking-gate.html and the one for the ED was replaced with a modified one from the Steins;Gate wiki: https://steins-gate.fandom.com/wiki/Toki_Tsukasadoru_Juuni_no_Meiyaku#English
